# LagCheck
A simple plugin to check a player's ping in PocketMine-MP!

This plugin adds the /ping command into your PocketMine server.

# /ping
The /ping usage is /ping <player> and will give you the specified player's current ping, along with a message telling you how strong their connection is. This can be useful for checking if a player is using Anti-Knockback, or is just lagging.
